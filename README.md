# Project summary
The project focuses on creating a 1:18 scale functional replica of Teslaâ€™s Cybertruck. The aim is to develop a high performance remote controlled vehicle that reflects both the design and dynamic capabilities of the original. 
The project integrates mechanical design, 3D printing, electronics, and advanced programming to build a fast, durable model capable of sharp turns and high speed stability.

Key components include a 3D printed chassis made from carbon reinforced nylon and polycarbonate for strength and durability. Arduino is used to control NeoPixel LED lights and manage communication between the controller and car. 
An Arduino Giga R1 oversees the smart charging system, allowing users to choose charging speeds and monitor battery health. More complex tasks, like controlling the servo and BLDC motors, are managed by an FPGA for precision.

So far, the project has reached a functional stage, with successful implementation of the 3D printing and essential programming. Testing has shown promising results in speed and stability, with communication extending up to 200m. 
Future improvements will focus on smart motor control and enhanced stability features.
